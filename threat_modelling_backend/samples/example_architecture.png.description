High Level Description:
This architecture diagram illustrates a prototype system built on AWS services, designed for threat modeling and analysis. The system incorporates various AWS components to handle user authentication, data storage, processing, and AI-driven threat analysis. It demonstrates a serverless architecture with event-driven processing and integration of AI capabilities.

1. Actors:
   1.1. Application User (represented by a person icon)

2. External Entities:
   No explicit external entities are shown in the diagram.

3. Data Stores:
   3.1. Amazon DynamoDB: Persistence of Threat Models
   3.2. Amazon S3: Uploaded Diagram Images
   3.3. Amazon S3: Static website (part of the Frontend)
   3.4. Amazon EventBridge: Message bus

4. Processes:
   4.1. AWS Lambda: Synchronous Resolvers
   4.2. AWS Lambda: Asynchronous Resolvers
   4.3. AWS Lambda: generateThreats Resolver
   4.5. AWS Step Functions: Generate Threats workflow
   4.6. Amazon Bedrock: Gen AI Models
   4.7. AWS AppSync: Managed GraphQL
   4.8. AWS Amplify: React library (part of the Frontend)
   4.9. Amazon CloudFront: Content Delivery Network
   4.10. Amazon Cognito: User authentication

5. Data Flows:
   5.1. From Browser to Amazon CloudFront, CloudFront is a CDN
   5.2. From Amazon CloudFront to Amazon S3, S3 is configured as a Static Website, only allowing access from CloudFront
   5.3. From Browser to Amazon Cognito, to authenticate and authorize login
   5.4. From Browser to AWS AppSync, for invoking APIs
   5.5. From AWS AppSync to AWS Lambda (Synchronous Resolver lambda function is directly triggered by AppSync)
   5.6. From AWS AppSync to Amazon EventBridge (To implement Async resolvers, we use a message bus)
   5.7. From Amazon EventBridge to AWS Lambda (Asynchronous Resolvers are triggered by events)
   5.8. From AWS Lambda (Asynchronous Resolvers) to Amazon DynamoDB
   5.9. From AWS Lambda (Asynchronous Resolvers) to Amazon S3 (Uploaded Diagram Images)
   5.10. From Amazon EventBridge to AWS Step Functions
   5.11. From AWS Step Functions to AWS Lambda (generateThreats Resolver)
   5.12. From AWS Lambda (generateThreats Resolver) to Amazon Bedrock
   5.13. From AWS Lambda (Synchronous Resolvers) to Amazon DynamoDB
   5.14. From AWS Lambda (Synchronous Resolvers) to Amazon Bedrock

6. Trust Boundaries:
   6.1. Frontend boundary: Encompasses Browser, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3 (Static website), and AWS Amplify
   6.2. Backend boundary: Encompasses all other AWS services within the AWS cloud
   6.3. User authentication boundary: Between Browser and Amazon Cognito
   6.4. API Gateway boundary: Between Frontend and AWS AppSync
   6.5. Data processing boundary: Between AWS AppSync and downstream services (Lambda, EventBridge, DynamoDB, S3)
   6.6. AI processing boundary: Between AWS Step Functions, Lambda (generateThreats), and Amazon Bedrock

This architecture demonstrates a sophisticated serverless system leveraging various AWS services to create a secure, scalable, and AI-enhanced threat modeling platform. The use of multiple AWS services provides layered security, scalability, and separation of concerns in processing and storing sensitive threat model data.
